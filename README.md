## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this election audit was to analyze the data and determine a winner of the polls. We were tasked with dissecting the data to output it into something an end user can digest using Python coding.

## Challenge Summary
This python script can be repurposed to be used for a variety of different elections, big or small! We can add a level by having a breakdown of total votes and vote percentage by state. Another way this script can be repurposed is by changing the variables to output those representing school board elections!
